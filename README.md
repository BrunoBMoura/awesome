# Awesome
This repository contains my personal configuration for Awesome. It is just a set of easy to use and expand configurations that I use in my daily work.

Works on `awesome` 4.3.

## Dependencies tracking

Regardless of your distribution, you will need to install `sysstat` and `acpi` and be using `pulseaudio` as your audio provider to have the full functionality of the widgets.

Also, a patched font, such as [JetBrainsMono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) is recommended to allow full visibility of the icons used in many of the configured widgets.
